            <h2>How to study - Study skills for learning effectively</h2>
            <h3>How to study effectively.</h3>
            <p>
                Studying effectively while doing your course will allow you to maximise your learning from the course.

                Below are some study methods that I think are most effective for gaining value from a course.

        <div class="text-one">
            <h3>Proactive Mindset & Routine</h3>
            <p>
                Prevent procrastination. Make a habit of starting your study work without delay. It's easy to become
                distracted by other things.

                But if you start and finish your work early you will have multiple benefits:

            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You will be finished early and will have free time to relax in the evening.</li>
                    <li>You will feel good when it's finished - you'll feel a sense of accomplishment.</li>
                    <li>Once you start your work, it's usually a bit more enjoyable and rewarding than you think it will
                        be.</li>
                </ul>
           
        </div>

        <div class="text-two">
            <h3>Reducing expectations and pressure</h3>
            <p>
                In order to get your work done it can be useful to reduce your expectations of the quality.
                Reduce the scope.
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make your goal to complete your study work, even if it isn't very good.</li>
                    <li>Once you have developed the habit of completing work you can then make an effort to perform well
                        at the work and produce quality work.</li>
                    <li>Consistently doing your work is more important than doing quality work at first.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="text-three">
            <h3>Comfortable work environment</h3>
            <p>
                You should have a quiet space that you can work in so that you donâ€™t get interrupted often while
                working.

                You should work in a well lit, ventilated room and have a comfortable chair to sit in.

        <div class="text-four">
            <h3>Health, Energy and taking breaks</h3>
            <p>
                You should try to get 7-8 hours of sleep at night if possible.

                If you are very tired you should take a 20 minute nap. When you wake up you should have a more clear
                head and be ready to do some more effective study.

                You should take regular breaks when you need them and have enough food to give you energy.

                If you feel very tired then you might need to take a break and consider if you have too much going on.

            <h3>Staying Motivated - by remembering why you are working</h3>
            <p>
                Check your reasons for studying in 'Why Study?' page if you need some motivation to study or if you find
                you aren't completing your study work.

                If you still aren't motivated it might be worth consulting with someone who could help you figure out a
                plan to move forward.
