# Study Tips Guide website

This is a website to help students to make the most of an education course through learning how to learn.

## UX

StudyTips is laid out in a way that steps through the pages linked in the header bar in a chronological way. The landing page is 'Home' where a student can learn about the purpose of the website. The next page is 'Why study?' to give reasons to the student to work at their course. The 'How to study' page then gives practical hints to the student on ways to improve study.
Following this there is an about page for a visitor wondering when the page was created and by who. Then for communication links the contact page is the final page in the header.

### User Stories

- As a student, I want to find resources for learning study skills in a clearly laid out guide with some images, so I can obtain this knowledge and apply this information in my courses.
